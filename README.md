### ROSPlan

ROSPlan (Robot Operating System Planning) is a planning framework for robotic systems that uses the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) to describe the problem domain. It is an open-source project hosted on GitHub, and can be found at the following repository: https://github.com/KCL-Planning/ROSPlan

This repository is maintained by the Planning group at King's College London, and provides a set of tools and libraries for integrating planning capabilities into robotic systems using the ROS (Robot Operating System) framework, used in this project (Harpia). The ROSPlan project provides a PDDL compiler for generating plans, as well as a ROS-based implementation of the PDDL forward-planning algorithm. The repository also includes example problem domains and sample code for using the system with various robotic platforms.

ROSPlan is widely used in the field of automated planning for robotics, it has been used in multiple research projects and also in industry. It is actively developed and maintained by the research group at King's College London and has a growing community of contributors.
